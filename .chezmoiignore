# EXAMPLE

# *.txt   # ignore *.txt in the target directory
# */*.txt # ignore *.txt in subdirectories of the target directory
        # but not in subdirectories of subdirectories;
        # so a/b/c.txt would *not* be ignored

# backups/   # ignore the backups folder, but not its contents
# backups/** # ignore the contents of backups folder but not the folder itself
